if you don't have "rosws" on your path: sudo apt-get install python-rosinstall

In the src directory of the beginings of an empty catkin workspace:

rosws init
rosws merge /opt/ros/$ROS_DISTRO
rosws merge https://code.cs.uml.edu/baxter/baxter_ws/blobs/raw/one-armed-bandit/workspace.rosinstall
rosws up
catkin_workspace_init
cd ..
catkin_make
source devel/setup.bash
